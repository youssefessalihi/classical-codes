# Password Validation Function

This is a JavaScript function that checks the strength of a password and ensures that it meets certain requirements. The function takes a word as an argument and performs the following checks:

1. Checks if the word contains at least one number.
2. Checks if the word contains at least one uppercase letter.
3. Checks if the word contains at least one lowercase letter.
4. Checks if the word length is at least 8 characters.

If any of these checks fail, an error message is printed to the console indicating what the user needs to fix.

## Usage

To use this function, simply call it with the word to be validated as an argument, like so:

```javascript
Validate("helloS1311")
